# Legion Go Refresh Rate - Decky Plugin

![plugin picture](./images/app-picture.png)

Decky Plugin workaround for 144hz on the Lenovo Legion Go

- only tested on Nobara v39 so far

# WARNING! READ THIS

This plugin enables 144hz without the artificial 72 fps cap bug

However, this means you **cannot** dock the device to a TV/Monitor on 144Hz

The only way to dock is to go back to 60Hz first.

When switching between 60Hz and 144Hz, all your open games will be closes, and Steam will restart.

Make sure you save your data first before swapping refresh rates!

# Install Instructions

### Prerequisites

Decky Loader must already be installed.

### Quick Install / Update

Run the following in terminal, then reboot. Note that this works both for installing or updating the plugin

```
curl -L https://github.com/aarron-lee/LegionGoRefreshRate/raw/main/install.sh | sh
```

# Disclaimer

this workaround has not been heavily tested yet, so please be aware that you may encounter bugs
